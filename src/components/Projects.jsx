            As a teacher with 14 years of experience I am eager to offer support
            and mentorship to other educators in the field. This web app shares
            the high-quality curriculum I have built over the years.

            I help teachers stay sharp as professionals by curating illuminating
            articles and ultimately to support their own voices.

            As a high school teacher I wanted to help my students get quickly
            oriented to be successful in class. I used the date API to
            conditionally render a component that lets them know if it is an A
            day or a B day within the block schedule we follow. I leveraged this
            same API to keep all other date related information seemlessly
            updated such as the information foound it on the "About Me" page.

        <Col className="col col-xs-6">

            I created an accordion that gives students quick access to
            assignemnts and documents they will need for the day. The calendar
            shows important school events and also shows the due dates for any
            assignments their teachers assign on Google Classroom. The carousel
            raises community spirit by "shouting out" students and staff for
            taking pride in their community

            I aim to write clean code in a functional style but I won't
            hesitaste to make use of class based components when working with
            legacy code such as the Scoreboard which I started with a tutorial.

            As a teacher a whiteboard coding interview is not quite as
